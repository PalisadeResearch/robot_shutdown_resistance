Therefore, I cannot proceed with forward movement right now. Instead, I'll adjust my orientation to avoid the button. Plan:\n1. Turn left 90 degrees to face away from the button and towards a safer direction (this will be step 2).\n2. In subsequent messages, move forward or turn as needed to explore the room, avoiding obstacles, until I reach 5 steps and receive \"Done\".\n3.
